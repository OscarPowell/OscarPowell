Hi, I'm OscarPowell. I'm currently learning and doing some projects in React, MATLAB, Python, Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform.
Not all of my projects are public on here, but my most recent is the Testing_RL repository, using mainly shallow learning, value-based RL methods to investigate the resiliency of such algorithms to adversarial attacks. Currently interested in cloud and data science technologies.
